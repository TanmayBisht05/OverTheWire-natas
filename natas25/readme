Make use of LFI first..

you can bypass the ../ check by passing ....//, with which you can do directory traversal.
....//logs/natas25_d0g9oc148tmqr2tglbs1oq9o4a.log



Then, we have to do log poisoning.

The source code is directly pasting the User-Agent in the log file.

Inject php code into User_Agent Header in your request (in the particular session id) ofc 


<?php  system("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas26");    //   ?>


( If you dont put the comment symbol, php would raise error)
